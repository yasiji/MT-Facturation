## Mandatory Files Per Interaction
- `mustread.md`
- `Agents.md`
- `tasks.md`
- `stack.md`
- `journal.md`

## Workflow
1. Read all mandatory files in required order.
2. Execute scoped work.
3. Update planning state in `tasks.md`.
4. Record actions, tests, risks, and decisions in `journal.md`.
5. Refresh `Last Updated` stamps in mandatory files.

## Entry Quality Rules
